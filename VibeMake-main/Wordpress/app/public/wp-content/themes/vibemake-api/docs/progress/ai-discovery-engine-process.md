# AI Discovery Engine Process

## Overview
Systematic process for importing AI tools data into WordPress with comprehensive, current information.

## Import Process Workflow

### 1. Research Phase
- Gather July 2025 data for each tool
- Verify valuations, user counts, latest features
- Identify key differentiators and partnerships

### 2. Script Creation
Each script follows consistent structure:
```php
// 1. WordPress authentication check
// 2. Create tool post with comprehensive content
// 3. Set ACF fields (tagline, features, pricing, stats)
// 4. Assign taxonomies (categories, creation types, user situations)
// 5. Display success with progress tracking
```

### 3. Data Points Captured
- **Company Info**: Founded date, funding, valuation
- **Usage Stats**: User counts, query volumes, market share
- **Features**: 6 key features with icons and descriptions
- **Pricing**: Model type and tier summary
- **Categories**: Proper taxonomy assignment

### 4. Completed Tools Analysis

#### Valuations/Funding
- Cursor: $9.9B (highest, fastest-growing)
- Perplexity: $18B 
- Midjourney: $10B
- Runway: $3B
- Claude: $70B acquisition offer declined
- Suno: $500M+

#### User Metrics
- ChatGPT: 200M weekly users
- Gemini: 500M+ monthly users
- Perplexity: 780M monthly queries
- Cursor: 1M+ daily developers

#### Key Trends

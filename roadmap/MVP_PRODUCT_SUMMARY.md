# ToolSchool.ai — MVP Product Summary

## Core Proposition

**ToolSchool.ai is an AI Trade School, not a tool directory.**

We teach people how to *work* with AI tools—through hands-on projects, cross-tool workflows, and role-specific curricula—so they can produce real outputs, not just collect certifications.

## The Four Pillars (MVP Focus)

| Pillar | What It Means | MVP Implementation |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Tool Fluency** | Know when and how to use each tool | Tool database with use-cases, comparisons, and decision guides |
| **Project Outputs** | Learn by building real deliverables | Guided projects with templates (e.g., "Build a sales deck with Claude + Gamma") |
| **Curriculum Refresh** | Content updated as tools evolve | Monthly tool updates, deprecation alerts, new feature coverage |
| **Role-Based Outcomes** | Skills tied to job functions | Start with Marketing Ops track; expand to Sales, Product, CS |
